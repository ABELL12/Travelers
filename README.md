<p> It was my first school trip since i have got to highschool.When I heard about the trip to The newly opened Ethiopian science museum i didn't hesitate to go. The trip was scheduled on Friday morning after we learn 3 periods. So after we learn the first three periods we started moving to the bus that was waiting outside of the school compound. As soon as all the students gathered the bus started moving and it was such a great joy to be in bus trip with all your classmates. We shouted,sang and did many things in the bus. We spent a great time in the bus although it was short time.</p> When we reach the museum we passed through some security details by doing as we told by the police. The place was such an amazing place there were many product of technologies that we didn't even thought there were in this country. one of the assistor in the museum suggested us to take a look on some screen that displays a map of the our city. and it told us this is an application used by Ride.company and they showed us how they organize the drivers to give service to customers. after we saw that we went to see the Robot that was dressed up in traditional Ethiopian cloths(habesh kemis). we also saw other robots in the museum and many more displays on the screen that advertise different works and companies. The one thing that attracted me is the smart Home. it looks like a home but with much more technology and comfort. After we visited most of the things there we went to the top of the building where there was a good view of the city.and in there we started to take photos of the place and ourselves to keep memory. after such great journey we went back to the bus to go back to the school. we arrived in school around 9:15 and after taking some rest we all went to our home by remembering the day that we spent with our friends.
